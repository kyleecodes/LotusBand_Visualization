# Spotify Visualization
A gentle audio visualization project in Python using the Spotify Restful API and Pycharm in Scientific Mode!

Visualize the differences between your favorite artists albums through time. How do their earlier albums compare to their new albums? Now you can visualize it!

Featuring the popular data engineering libraries pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries.

Written in various methods (onefile, functions, and classes) simply for learning. 

## Try it yourself
*If trying this for yourself, understand that onefile.py, functions.py, and classes.py are all the same file, just using different methods. 
I would recommend using the classes file as it is the most reusuable.*

After cloning this repo, you will need the following variables after registering your app with a Spotify Developer account to gain access to the Spotify API:
- `client_id`
- `client_secret`

Next, find an artist you would like to perform data analysis on. You can obtain it's artist_id by going to the artist's Spotify page, ckicking "share" and copying the Spotify URI.
